# SLSA (in-toto style)

Upstream for S2C2F sections: https://github.com/ossf/s2c2f/blob/98803e0a558e6d8cef4d2770864ffd3cf7618c65/specification/framework.md#appendix-relation-to-scitt

## S2C2F: Appendix: Relation to SCITT

> The [Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust](https://github.com/ietf-scitt) initiative, or SCITT, is a set of proposed industry standards for managing the compliance of goods and services across end-to-end supply chains. In the future, we expect teams to output "attestations of conformance" to the S2C2F requirements and store it in SCITT. The format of such attestations is to be determined.

# S2C2F: Appendix: Mapping Secure Supply Chain Consumption Framework Requirements to Other Specifications

There are many other security frameworks, guides, and controls. This section maps the S2C2F Framework requirements to other relevant specifications including NIST SP 800-161, NIST SP 800-218, CIS Software Supply Chain Security Guide, OWASP Software Component Verification Standard, SLSA, and the CNCF Software Supply Chain Best Practices.
